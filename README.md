# Summary

This project aims at developing a set of features for managing a condominium.
The intended users are the actual owners of the condominium, rather than some professional entities.
As such, a particular care effort is expected towards the ease of use and general support in each and every task.

The development process is opportunistic: a feature starts being developped as soon as its need is confirmed and the resources to do it are available.
No particular plan is followed based on any kind of objective criterion.
